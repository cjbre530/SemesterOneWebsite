    <p class="para"><img src="../images/line.png" width="22" />My name is Cameron Brethauer and I am the creator of the game, "Asteroid Dodge"!
    This chart displays all my activities throughout the day. My days usually consist of regular teenage
    boy activities, like sleeping and playing video games. I am into engineering though, and it can be shown
    through my software and hardware capabilities.<img src="../images/line.png" width="22" /></p>
